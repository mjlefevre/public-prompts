# Technical → Business Translation

Engineers and business stakeholders speak different languages. This prompt bridges the gap by rewriting technical content for a business audience — preserving the meaning while removing implementation details. Useful for status updates, project summaries, or explaining technical decisions to leadership.

## The Prompt

Rewrite this technical content for a business stakeholder who doesn't have a technical background.

Translation rules:
- **Remove**: Implementation details, code references, technical specifications
- **Keep**: Impact, outcomes, timelines, risks, costs, benefits
- **Translate**: Technical concepts into business concepts
  - "Refactoring" → "Improving the foundation to move faster later"
  - "Technical debt" → "Shortcuts that will slow us down if not addressed"
  - "API" → "Connection point between systems"
  - "Latency" → "Speed / response time"
  - "Scalability" → "Ability to handle growth"

Focus on:
- **What** is happening (not how)
- **Why** it matters to the business
- **When** it will be done
- **What** the risks are
- **What** decisions or support is needed

Format for skimmability:
- Lead with the bottom line
- Use bullet points
- Bold key terms and numbers
- Keep paragraphs short
