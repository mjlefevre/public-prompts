- **[just-bullet-points](./just-bullet-points.md)**: Strip content to pure bullets — maximum information density, no prose

## Restructuring & Reformatting

Prompts that reorganize content for clarity and accessibility.

- **[break-into-sections](./break-into-sections.md)**: Convert wall-of-text into hierarchical sections and bullet points
- **[eli5-explain](./eli5-explain.md)**: Rewrite for non-technical readers — analogies, simple words, no jargon
