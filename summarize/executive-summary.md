Format:
- **Bottom Line**: One sentence — what's the key takeaway?
- **Context**: 2-3 sentences — why does this matter now?
- **Key Points**: 3-5 bullet points — the essential facts
- **Risks/Concerns**: What could go wrong? What's uncertain?
- **Decision Needed**: What action or decision is required? By when?
