# Meeting Notes → Next Steps

Meetings produce discussion but not always clarity. This prompt transforms raw meeting notes or transcripts into structured output that drives accountability: what was discussed, what was decided, who does what next. Turns a 60-minute meeting into a 2-minute read with clear ownership.
