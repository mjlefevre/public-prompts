# Prepend TLDR

Long documents bury the point. This prompt front-loads the key takeaways so readers can decide in 30 seconds whether to keep reading. Especially useful for technical docs, reports, or anything over a page. The TLDR becomes a contract with the reader: "here's what you'll get if you invest the time."

## The Prompt

Read this content and summarize it. Then prepend a TLDR section at the very top of the document.

Requirements:
- Title the section "## TLDR"
- Write 8-12 sentences that capture the essential points
- Cover: what this is, why it matters, key conclusions or recommendations
- Write for someone who may not read further — this should stand alone
- Keep the original content intact below the TLDR
