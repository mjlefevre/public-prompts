# Break Into Sections & Bullet Points

Wall-of-text content is hard to scan and harder to reference later. This prompt restructures prose into a hierarchical outline with clear sections and bullet points. Turns rambling paragraphs into something you can skim in 30 seconds and find specific information in later.

## The Prompt

Reorganize this content into a well-structured document with clear sections and bullet points.

Guidelines:
- **Identify logical groupings** — What are the major themes or topics?
- **Create descriptive section headers** — Headers should tell you what's in the section without reading it
- **Convert prose to bullets** — Each bullet = one idea, fact, or point
- **Preserve hierarchy** — Use sub-bullets for details, examples, or supporting points
- **Keep bullets concise** — Aim for one line; two max
- **Front-load each bullet** — Put the key word or concept first

Structure:
```
## [Major Topic 1]

- Key point
  - Supporting detail
  - Example or evidence
- Another key point

## [Major Topic 2]
...
```

Preserve:
- All information from the original (don't summarize, reorganize)
- Important quotes or specific data
- Nuance and caveats

Add if helpful:
- A one-paragraph summary at the top
- Cross-references between related sections
