# ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Technical content often excludes people who need to understand it. This prompt forces a rewrite that prioritizes accessibility over precision. Useful for explaining concepts to non-technical stakeholders, onboarding new team members, or testing whether you actually understand something — if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

## The Prompt

Rewrite this content so a non-technical person with no background in this area could understand it.

Guidelines:
- Use analogies to everyday things (cooking, driving, building, etc.)
- Define every acronym and technical term inline, in plain language
- Replace jargon with simple words (don't say "leverage" when you mean "use")
- Use concrete examples instead of abstract concepts
- Break complex ideas into smaller pieces
- If something is genuinely complicated, acknowledge it: "This part is tricky, but here's the key idea..."
- Aim for an 8th-grade reading level

Preserve:
- The core meaning and accuracy
- The structure (if it helps comprehension)
- Any important caveats or limitations
