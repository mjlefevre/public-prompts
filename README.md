# Public Prompts

A collection of prompts shared freely for anyone to use and benefit from — insights gathered over the past three years working with agentic flows, tips, tricks, and more. 

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Adapt as needed** — use an agentic AI client (such as Claude Code) to customize these prompts for your workflow
3. **Experiment freely** — build, create, and iterate

## License & Contribution Policy

This repository is **open for use** but is not a traditional open-source project. You are welcome to fork, copy, and use these prompts however you see fit. However, pull requests may or may not be accepted — this collection is primarily maintained for personal use and shared publicly as a resource.

## Notes

- The [external_fabric_prompts.md](external_fabric_prompts.md) file contains a **catalog only** (not the actual prompt content) of patterns from the [Fabric framework](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) by Daniel Miessler. Fabric is MIT licensed — the listing is provided here for reference purposes.
